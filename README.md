An application that applies the widescreen mod to Star Trek Voyager Elite Force.

## Requirements for compiling code

---

You must use a compiler that supports atleast C++17 and most importantly it must support the File system library. Visit [this](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/17) page to see if your compiler meets these requirements.

I used VSCode with Clang 12.0.1 and the VSCode json files are already setup to use it. Feel free to use wichever IDE/code editor and compiler you wish.

## Before compiling

---

If you decide to use my preset settings, you must create a folder called "compiled" in the root. VSCode will compile the application to this folder.
